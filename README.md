# CS 412(Machine Learning)Project Report <br/><br/>

1) Problem Definition<br/>
Our goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies 5 different types of skin cancers with best accuracy possible based on the
skin images which were provided to us. These cancer types are: Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic nevus (NV), Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 
Actinic keratosis (AK), Benign keratosis (BKL). <br/>

For further information about the project, please take a look at the CS412 Project Report file.<br/>
